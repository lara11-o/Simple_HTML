<p class="center">Marie Sklodowska Curie (/'kj??ri/ KEWR-ee;[3] French: [ky?i]; Polish: [k?i'ri]),<br>
 born Maria Salomea Sklodowska (Polish: ['marja sal?'m?a skw?'d?fska]; 7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934),<br>
  was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity.</p>
	
<p class="center">As the first of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes, she was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize,<br>
 the first person and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields.<br>
  She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.</p>
	
<p class="center">She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire.<br>
 She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw.<br>
  In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronislawa to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and<br>
	 conducted her subsequent scientific work.</p>
	 
<p class="center">She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and physicist Henri Becquerel,<br>
 for their pioneering work developing the theory of "radioactivity" (a term she coined).[5][6]<br>
  Using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes, she won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of two elements,<br>
	 polonium and radium.</p>
	 
<p class="center">Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms using radioactive isotopes.<br>
 She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today.<br>
  During World War I she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.</p>
	
<p class="center">While a French citizen, Marie Sklodowska Curie, who used both surnames,[7][8] never lost her sense of Polish identity.<br>
 She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland.[9] She named the first chemical element she discovered polonium,<br>
  after her native country.</p>
	
<p class="center">Marie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy (Haute-Savoie),<br>
 France, of aplastic anaemia from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her<br>
  radiological work at field hospitals during World War I.[11] In 1995, she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon in Paris.</p>
