<p class="center">Alexander Graham Bell (/'gre?.?m/; March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922)[3] was a Scottish-born[N 2] inventor, scientist,<br>
 and engineer who is credited with inventing and patenting the first practical telephone.<br>
  He also co-founded the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1885.</p>
	
<p class="center">Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech and both his mother and wife were deaf,<br>
 profoundly influencing Bell's life's work.[7] His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices<br>
  which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone, on March 7, 1876.[N 3]<br>
	 Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.</p>
	 
<p class="center">Many other inventions marked Bell's later life, including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils, and aeronautics.<br>
 Although Bell was not one of the 33 founders[10] of the National Geographic Society, he had a strong influence on the magazine while<br>
  serving as the second president from January 7, 1898, until 1903.</p>
	
<p class="center">Beyond his scientific work, Bell was an advocate of compulsory sterilization and served as chairman or president of several eugenics organizations.
