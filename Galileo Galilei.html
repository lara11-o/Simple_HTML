<p class="center">Galileo di Vincenzo Bonaiuti de' Galilei (Italian: [gali'l??o gali'l?i]; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642) was an Italian astronomer,<br>
 physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath, from Pisa.[3] Galileo has been called the "father of observational astronomy",[4]<br>
  the "father of modern physics",[5][6] the "father of the scientific method",[7] and the "father of modern science".</p>
	
<p class="center">Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia,<br>
 projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and "hydrostatic balances".<br>
  He invented the thermoscope and various military compasses, and used the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects.<br>
	 His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus,<br>
	  the observation of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, the observation of Saturn's rings, and the analysis of sunspots.</p>
		
<p class="center">Galileo's championing of heliocentrism and Copernicanism met with opposition from within the Catholic Church and from some astronomers.<br>
 The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was "foolish and absurd in philosophy,<br>
  and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture".</p>
	
<p class="center">Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632),<br>
 which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated both the Pope and the Jesuits,<br>
  who had both supported Galileo up until this point.[9] He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy",<br>
	 and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest.[12][13] During this time, he wrote Two New Sciences (1638),<br>
	  primarily concerning kinematics and the strength of materials, summarizing work he had done some forty years earlier.</p>
