<p class="center ">Archimedes of Syracuse (/???rk?'mi?di?z/;[2] Ancient Greek: ????µ?d??; Doric Greek: [ar.k?i.m??.d?^?s];<br>
 c.?287 – c.?212 BC) was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer.[3]<br>
  Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity.<br>
	 Considered to be the greatest mathematician of ancient history, and one of the greatest of all time,[4][5][6][7][8][9]<br>
	  Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to<br>
		 derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems, including: the area of a circle; the surface area and volume of a sphere;<br>
		  area of an ellipse; the area under a parabola; the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution; the volume of a segment <br>
			of a hyperboloid of revolution; and the area of a spiral.</p>
<p class="center ">His other mathematical achievements include deriving an accurate approximation of pi;<br>
 defining and investigating the spiral that now bears his name; and creating a system using exponentiation for expressing <br>
 very large numbers. He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, founding hydrostatics and statics,<br>
  including an explanation of the principle of the lever. He is credited with designing innovative machines, such as his screw pump,<br>
	 compound pulleys, and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion.</p>
	 
<p class="center ">Archimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse, where he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed.<br>
 Cicero describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder,<br>
  which Archimedes had requested be placed on his tomb to represent his mathematical discoveries.</p>
	
<p class="center ">Unlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity.<br>
 Mathematicians from Alexandria read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until c.?530<br>
  AD by Isidore of Miletus in Byzantine Constantinople, while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by Eutocius <br>
	in the 6th century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time.<br>
	 The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the Middle Ages were an influential<br>
	  source of ideas for scientists during the Renaissance, while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by Archimedes <br>
		in the Archimedes Palimpsest has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.</p>
