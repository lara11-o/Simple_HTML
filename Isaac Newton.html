<p class="center"> Isaac Newton PRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27[a]) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer,<br>
 theologian, and author (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the<br>
  most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis<br>
	 Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, established classical mechanics.<br>
	  Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.</p>
		

<p class="center">In Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until<br>
 it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion,<br>
 account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena,<br>
  eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth<br>
 and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid<br>
  was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists <br>
	of the superiority of Newtonian echanics over earlier systems.</p>

<p class="center">Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation<br>
 that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. His work on light was collected in his highly influential<br>
  book Opticks, published in 1704. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound,<br>
	 and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study <br>
	 of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function,<br>
	  and classified most of the cubic plane curves.</p>
		

<p class="center">Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.<br>
 He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. Unusually for a member of the<br>
  Cambridge faculty of the day, he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences,<br>
	 Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished<br>
	  until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for<br>
		 the University of Cambridge, in 1689–90 and 1701–02. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London,<br>
		  serving as Warden (1696–1699) and Master (1699–1727) of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).</p>
