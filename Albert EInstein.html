<p class="center">Albert Einstein (/'a?nsta?n/ EYEN-styne;[4] German: ['alb??t '?a?n?ta?n] (About this soundlisten);<br>
 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist[5] who developed the theory of relativity,<br>
  one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).[3][6] <br>
	His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[7][8]<br>
	 He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2,<br>
	  which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".[9]<br>
		 He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics,<br>
		  and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[10] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</p>
			

<p class="center">The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in the German Empire,<br>
 but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. Specializing in physics and mathematics,<br>
  he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. The following year,<br>
	 he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work,<br>
	  from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.</p>
		

<p class="center">Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer<br>
 be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity <br>
 during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'),<br>
  he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the attention of the academic world;<br>
	 the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second explained Brownian motion,<br>
	  the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26,<br>
		 he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich.</p>
		 

<p class="center">Although initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community,<br>
 Einstein's works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements.<br>
  He was invited to teach theoretical physics at the University of Bern in 1908 and the following year moved to <br>
	the University of Zurich, then in 1911 to Charles University in Prague before returning to ETH (the newly renamed<br>
	 Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin,<br>
	  where he remained for 19 years. Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend<br>
		 the theory to gravitational fields; he then published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation.<br>
		  He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle<br>
			 theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation,<br>
			  the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917,<br>
				 he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.[11][12]</p>
				 

<p class="center">In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background,<br>
 Einstein did not return to Germany.[13] He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.[14]<br>
  On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German<br>
	 nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies,<br>
	  but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.</p>
		

<p class="center">Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,<br>
 New Jersey, until his death in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works.[11][15]<br>
  His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".[16]<br>
	 Eugene Wigner compared him to his contemporaries, writing that "Einstein's understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann's.<br>
	  His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann's."[17]</p>
